# Despot's Game Mutation Helper v1.0

This tool can help you choose your mutation, and help you decide to reroll or not.


## How to use

You need `Python3` installed on your computer. Then you run the tool with
`python3 dg_helper.py`
 A first popup lets you select the classes you want to run, and the next popup will show you the available mutations at your floor. You can click on the mutations you pick to advance.


## Future improvements

Currently the tool is in an early development stage. Two functionalities will be added:
- One to order the mutations and save your preferences
- With this order, a reroll helper, to give you the probabilities that a reroll will improve the mutations.
